Service Index: The index of each sub-array in the services array is the index of the service, starting from 0. For example, the index of the first service is 0, and the corresponding task sequence is [1, 2, 9]; 
the index of the second service is 1, and the corresponding task sequence is [1, 2, 15], and so on.
Task Sequence: Each element in the sub-array represents the task number required to complete the service. 
For example, for the service with index 0, tasks numbered 1, 2, and 9 need to be completed in sequence to complete this service.
